# virtio-accel-core

Transport-independent accelerator lifecycle traits: backend discovery, memory, program,
execution-queue, and event contracts. Provider backends written against this crate never
receive guest addresses or virtqueue descriptors.

Part of the [`virtio-accel`](https://github.com/MicroPerceptron/virtio-accel) workspace: an experimental, native-Rust foundation for a
transport-neutral virtual accelerator device. Portable crates contain no host-OS or vendor APIs;
host integrations live in separate adapter crates and never become their dependencies. The
project claims no Virtio device ID.

**Portability tier:** `core-only` — `core` only; no `alloc`, no operating system, no host synchronization.

The protocol 1.0 numeric opcodes, statuses, and payload layouts are versioned review inputs for
independent implementation, frozen for the portable v1.0 baseline by the
[final freeze audit](https://github.com/MicroPerceptron/virtio-accel/blob/main/conformance/v1.0/freeze-audit.md). This remains pre-standardization
work and claims no Virtio device ID.
